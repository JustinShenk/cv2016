    "This exercise is supposed to be very easy, does not give any points, and is voluntary. There will be a similar exercise on every sheet. It is intended to revise some basic mathematical notions that are assumed throughout this class and to allow you to check if you are comfortable with them. Usually you should have no problem to answer these questions offhand, but if you feel unsure, this is a good time to look them up again. You are always welcome to discuss questions with the tutors or in the practice session. Also, if you have a (math) topic you would like to recap, please let us know."
